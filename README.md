 # Sentiment Analysis
 
 With my Sentiment Analysis (React) project, by analyzing the ticket message texts written by the customers who have any complaints about the company's products in the Ticket Forms, where they indicate their complaints, determine their mood, showing these results to the Support team with an Emoji and "Star Rate", I can tell the support team which ticket is more urgently answered. I have a project with a Request for APIs using Tensorflow AI, which helps to decide what is needed.
